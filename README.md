🎵 Music Generation with RNN
A deep learning project that generates music using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This project is based on sequence modeling with LSTM networks to learn patterns from musical data and generate new compositions in ABC notation.

🚀 Features
✅ Train an RNN model on ABC-notation music data
✅ Generate unique music compositions
✅ Convert generated sequences into playable music
✅ Leverage TensorFlow, NumPy, and MIT Deep Learning libraries

🛠️ Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Music_Generation_RNN.git

2️⃣ Install Required Packages
For Mac:
brew install abcmidi timidity
For Ubuntu/Linux:
sudo apt-get install abcmidi timidity

🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Convert ABC notation into a numerical format
2️⃣ Model Training – Train an LSTM-based RNN to learn musical sequences
3️⃣ Text Generation – Generate new sequences based on learned patterns
4️⃣ Convert to Music – Convert predictions back into ABC notation

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	TensorFlow/Keras
	•	NumPy & Matplotlib
	•	MIT Deep Learning Library

📌 Future Improvements

🔹 Improve model training with GRU or Transformer-based architectures
🔹 Generate MIDI files directly instead of ABC notation
🔹 Create an interactive web-based UI to generate and play music
